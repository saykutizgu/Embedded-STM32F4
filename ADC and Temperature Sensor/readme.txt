This is an example of reading temperature data from STM32F401RE board using TrueSTUDIO IDE.

Internal temperature sensor of STM32 board is used with board's internal Analog to Digital Converter to read raw temperature value.

After reading the raw temperature value, real temperature value is obtained by calibration which is found online.
